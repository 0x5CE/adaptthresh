### Adaptive Local Threshold Algorithms

Python implementation of algorithms described in the paper [Efficient implementation of local adaptive thresholding techniques using integral images](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221253734_Efficient_implementation_of_local_adaptive_thresholding_techniques_using_integral_images)

### Basic Usage

Function doimg takes image path, threshold, w (window size), k as arguments and outputs black-and-white and compares performance of the algorithms.

**Requires NumPy and Python 3.x**
